# baobab
project
Well, Hello, this is my first readme.
This is more a project for a friend of mine, she is a baker, and i like her initiative, she wants to help a community in Malawi.
At first i started with bootstrap, but more i added on my html file and css file, i start loosing track on what i have done, and many changes did not showed at first, i did panic...
Now, my project was mostly or just code from W3schools, which i find easier to use.
The more i start added code, the more i felt i will make to hard to read, even for me, so i kept it simple
I have 3 files, the index file which has just some cakes that she made, a logo and the city we live in, simple enough
The other one was the community file, the more i start working with the images, since i wanted to showcase some of the kids from there, the more i wanted to go there myself.
The last file is just a simple photo, well will soon be a image of her actually caffe.
Things changed now, i write this so i can remember the times i wrote this, during this pandemic, everthing changed, my life as well
This website is more like a gateway for people to buy cake and help the community in malawi, i also added her intial website where people can donate or help the kids there.
Thanks for reading.
